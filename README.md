A simple mod that adds custom music discs to be played in my Survival world's outdoor concert venue.
Or, I guess,

Many thanks to [@FoundationGames](https://github.com/FoundationGames) for making the code of
his awesome [Sandwichable](https://github.com/FoundationGames/Sandwichable) mod so easy to
understand and learn from, and similarly to
[Modding by Kaupenjoe](https://www.youtube.com/c/TKaupenjoe) for his awesome and detailed
tutorials on Minecraft modding, in this case
[his tutorial for adding a custom villager profession](https://gist.github.com/Kaupenjoe/237846a971fdd254c7da9639c85e65c1)

Also shouting out [@Siphalor](https://github.com/Siphalor) and Reddit's
[jSdCool](https://www.reddit.com/user/jSdCool/) for
[this conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/fabricmc/comments/mkumx8/comment/gticqn2/) on adding
non-mod external libraries to a Fabric mod. It should not have been this hard to add the SnakeYAML
library to a mod.
