## What is This?

FoxNap is a simple "Vanilla Plus" mod for adding custom music discs to Minecraft.

* Unlike what you can achieve with
  [resource packs alone](https://www.planetminecraft.com/blog/how-to-add-costume-music-the-easy-way-1-12/)
  music discs added via FoxNap **do not overwrite** the vanilla music discs.
* Unlike similar mods, FoxNap allows you to:
    * add as many or as few music discs as you want
    * add _whatever_ music you want
    * use _different_ music than other players on the same server
    * obtain all music discs in survival, via a
      [new villager profession](#obtaining-records-and-more)
      ([utilities for modifying creeper / treasure chest loot tables are planned](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/FoxNap/issues/16))

FoxNap also adds custom musical instruments that you can play like goat horns,
giving you the creative freedom to stage
["live music" performances](https://www.google.com/search?q=lip+syncing+concert).

## Setup and Customization

2. [Camille Saint-SaÃ«ns: "Danse Macabre," performed by Kevin MacLeod](https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Kevin_MacLeod/Classical_Sampler)

* Four tracks performed by [PM Music](https://pmmusic.pro)
  from [Lud and Schlatts Musical Emporium](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbtXFIaAJ0fOtgyeDs8Jog/)

    3. [Richard Strauss: Theme from _Also Sprach
       Zarathustra_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9K3GQdD30F0)

       Juliet_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unvW5g_YWEk)

7. [Nikokai Rimsky-Korsakov: "Flight of the Bumblebee" from _Tsar

If this built-in playlist sounds like your jam, and you have no desire to add anything else, then
congrats! This is easy! This is a Fabric mod with builds for 1.19+ and depends only on
the [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api), so just download
the appropriate build to your instance's mods folder, start the game, and
[go find a village](#obtaining-records-and-more).

But if you're interested in some customization, read on:

## Resource Pack Generator

While you can always [manually](../../wiki/Manual-Resource---Data-Pack-Creation)
convert mp3s and hand-edit JSON files to create a set of Fox Nap
packs, **this project
provides an alternative** in the form of a stand-alone and portable (read: no installation or
setup required) resource pack generator.

You can read more about that [here](../../wiki/Resource-Pack-Generator).

## What About Multiplayer?

When playing on a server, it's the ***server's*** datapacks and config file that will dictate:

- how long each song will play
- the redstone signal strength coming out of jukeboxes playing each disc
- the number of tracks available from the Maestro

but it's ***each player's*** resource pack and config file that will control:

- the songs that each disc will play
- the appearance (and description) of each disc
- which discs show up as "placeholder" records

Explicitly:

- if the server has a greater number of discs specified than both what you've specified in your
  config, some discs will show up for you with placeholder
  textures and sound files
- if you have more discs in your resource pack than are set on the server, then not all tracks will
  be available in your shared game
- some music discs may continue silently after a song ends, and some might cut off

Beyond the number of discs, though, there's no reason why every player can't come online with
a completely custom playlist of songs with similar lengths!

## Obtaining Records _and More!_

So now that you've registered these custom records to the game, how do you actually get them?
Outside of commands (_e.g._ `/give @s foxnap:track_1`) and Creative Mode, the sole way to obtain
FoxNap records is by trading with _The Maestro_, a new villager who has a Jukebox as a job site
(note
that [The Maestro does not currently spawn naturally, but this feature is planned](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/FoxNap/issues/13)).

![The Maestro](_static/maestro.png)

The Maestro will pay top dollar for [tonewood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tonewood)--stripped
blocks of rare wood types--goat horns and non-FoxNap records and sells, alongside your custom
music discs, a wide variety of playable musical instruments (with textures adopted from the classic
[mxTune mod](https://github.com/AeronicaMC/mxTune)).

### Disabling The Maestro

If you'd prefer _not_ to add The Maestro to your game (and would like to obtain your music discs
in some other way, such as a datapack), you can disable this part of the mod by editing your
[`foxnap.yaml` config file](#manual-resource--data-pack-creation) and adding the following line:

```yaml
enable_maestro: false
```

## Fox Nap Vanilla

With the release of Minecraft 1.21, music discs are now entirely data-driven! As such, the
resource and datapacks generated by the Fox Nap Resource Pack Generator are entirely compatible
with the vanilla game. Details can be found on
[the wiki](../../wiki/Using-the-Resource-Pack-Generator-in-Vanilla).

Many thanks to [@FoundationGames](https://github.com/FoundationGames) for making the code of
his awesome [Sandwichable](https://github.com/FoundationGames/Sandwichable) mod so easy to
understand and learn from, and similarly to
[Modding by Kaupenjoe](https://www.youtube.com/c/TKaupenjoe) for his awesome and detailed
tutorials on Minecraft modding, in this case
[his tutorial for adding a custom villager profession](https://gist.github.com/Kaupenjoe/237846a971fdd254c7da9639c85e65c1).

Also shouting out [@Siphalor](https://github.com/Siphalor) and Reddit's
[jSdCool](https://www.reddit.com/user/jSdCool/) for
[this conversation](https://www.reddit.com/r/fabricmc/comments/mkumx8/comment/gticqn2/) on adding
non-mod external libraries to a Fabric mod. It should not have been this hard to add the SnakeYAML
library to a mod.
