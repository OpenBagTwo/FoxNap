A simple mod that adds custom music discs to be played in my Survival world's outdoor concert venue.
Or, I guess,
anywhere jukeboxes can be found.

## Setup and Use

_TODO_

## Resource Pack Generator

This repo also contains a stand-alone resource pack generator to simplify the process of adding
your own music discs.

### Installation

The resource pack generator is entirely portable and comes bundled
with all dependencies that are needed to run it. No installation
necessary--simply download the executable for your particular computer
and operating system from [the release page](../../releases) that
matches your version of the FoxNap mod.

#### Building from Source

You can also build the generator from source.

1. Clone this repo
1. [Download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) or install a version of `ffmpeg` that can decode
   files from your music library and that has support for encoding using `libvorbis`. Put the
   executable (or symbolic links to the executable) in the `foxnap_rpg/bin` folder.
1. Create and activate a virtual environment using python 3.10 or above
1. From the repo's root run `python -m pip install .`

### Usage

#### Any Operating System

Place the generator executable in an empty folder, then move any music you
want to turn into records into that folder. **There is no limit** to the
number of tracks you can include, and they **do not** need to be pre-converted
to [Ogg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg). **The only requirement** is that
the files have to be
[decodable by `ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/general.html#Supported-File-Formats_002c-Codecs-or-Features)
.

_**Pro Tip:** if your music files include [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3), the title
and artist
name will get automatically extracted, and any album art will be used to help generate the music
disc texture._

When you're ready, simply double-click the `FoxNapRPG` executable. A terminal window should pop
up showing progress of the resource pack creation, and before you know it you should soon have a
new file in your folder named `FoxNapRP.zip`, which you can then add as a resource pack to your
game. You will then need to go into your minecraft `config` folder and edit `foxnap.yaml` to raise
the number of `n_discs` to include the ones added by the resource pack (this number needs to be
the number of built-in tracks plus the number of custom tracks you added).

#### Bonus for Windows Only

If you're a Windows user, you can _also_ take a folder containing all your music and _drag and drop
it onto_ `FoxNapRPG.exe`,
which will create `FoxNapRP.zip` in the folder containing the exe.

#### Advanced Users (any operating system)

You can also run the generator from the command-line, which will give you access to a bunch of
additional customization options.

For details, run

```bash
$ ./FoxNapRPG --help
```

from the folder where you saved the generator executable.

non-mod external libraries to a Fabric mod. It should not have been this hard to add the SnakeYAML
library to a mod.
