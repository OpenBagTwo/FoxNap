# # Building a Resource Pack Generator
#
# I'm developing a mod called [FoxNap](https://github.com/OpenBagTwo/FoxNap/) which provides the player with custom musical instruments and music discs. The "killer app" of this mod, besides making all custom items avaialble in survival via villager trades, is that rather than provide a library of music discs, the user can just set the number of music discs to however many they want, and then the mod will dynamically create registrations for that many discs. From there, it's up to the _client_ (read: player) to provide the tracks themselves via a resource pack. Practically what that means is:
# - if you're playing single-player, you can add whatever copyrighted music you want to play in your own personal game
# - if you're a content creator, you can populate the tracks with your own royalty-free music selections
# - if you play on a server, you can populate the tracks with the music that _you_ have the rights to use while your friend populates the tracks with the music that _they_ have the rights to use
# - regardless of the situation, you can _swap resource packs_ as the mood strikes, to swap out your music library.
#
# This functionality is there now--the issue is that creating a resource pack from scratch is tedious work, and that's even assuming you've already got everything ready as mono oggs.
#
# So what I'm going to be building out now is a series of steps that will:
#
# 1. Convert a mp3, wav, flac or _any_ [`ffmpeg`](https://ffmpeg.org/)-compatible audio format to the correct ogg format
# 1. Create a custom music disc item texture
# 1. Populate that disc into a new or existing resource pack, complete with language file entries
#
# Once I've got the mechanics down, the next step will be creating a cross-platform (I'm gonna have to create a Windows VM ðŸ¤¢) stand-alone binary (possibly with a _graphical user interface_ ðŸ¤®) for distribution with the mod. But that's beyond the scope of this notebook.

# ## Converting audio with ffmpeg-python

# <div class="alert alert-block alert-warning"><h3>Problem</h3>
#
# Relying on `ffmpeg` is going to make bundling a package for cross-platform distrubution
# tricky. For a minute it looked like I'd lucked out and could use `conda`, but the conda
# package isn't compiled with libvorbis support, so I'll probably have to bundle
# a custom ffmpeg executable with whatever package I distribute.
# </div>

# The conversion process I've been using thusfar involves calling `ffmpeg` from the command line:
#
# ```bash
# $ ffmpeg -i some_music.mp3 -c:a libvorbis -ac 1 -map a some_music.ogg
# ```
#
# and I could just keep doing that directly via `subprocess`. But there's also [this handy wrapper](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python) I found for ffmpeg, and letting someone else handle the system calls is much more my jam.

# The track I'll be working with is ["Higher" by Tobu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blA7epJJaR4), which:
# * slaps
# * [is available for free download](https://tobu.io/Higher/download)
# * is licensed extremely permissively
# * contains album art embedded in the mp3, which I'll talk more about in a sec

# But to start, let's load the track.

# In[4]:


higher = ffmpeg.input(os.fspath(assets_folder / "Tobu - Higher.mp3"))


# Since I'm not doing any filters, this should be pretty straightforward. And what I love about this library is that it gives me a really easy way to preview the command I'm about to run.

# In[5]:


print(higher.audio.output("higher.ogg", acodec="libvorbis", ac=1).compile())


# I'm following my nose reading their docs and [examples](https://github.com/kkroening/ffmpeg-python/blob/f3079726fae7b7b71e4175f79c5eeaddc1d205fb/examples/README.md), so I hope this is right, but I guess I'll find out in a second.

# In[6]:


higher.audio.output(
    os.fspath(assets_folder / "higher.ogg"), acodec="libvorbis", ac=1
).overwrite_output().run()


# That appears to have completed successfully. Let's try something neat:

# In[7]:


Audio(assets_folder / "higher.ogg")


# Well that was cool!

# ## Record Texture

# I've included two template textures: a regular record and colored vinyl

# In[8]:


record_template = Image.open(assets_folder / "template_black.png")
colored_vinyl_template = Image.open(assets_folder / "template_colored_vinyl.png")

for image in (record_template, colored_vinyl_template):
    display(image.resize((160, 160), resample=0))


# Two elements of customization here:
#
# - The center of each template is transparent, allowing us to layer in a (5x3 lol) custom image from, say, the album art
# - The colored vinyl's color can be changed via a simple hue transform.

# ### Hue Transform
#
# Since we'll want to do the hue transform before performing the overlay, we'll start there.

# First step is to convert the image from RGB to HSV:

# In[9]:


hsv = colored_vinyl_template.convert("HSV")


# From here there might be an efficient high-level method to do the color shift, but we're dealing with a 16x16 image here--we don't really need an extremely performant solution. So let's keep it simple and just loop over the pixels.

# In[10]:


accesser = hsv.load()

for i in range(hsv.size[0]):
    for j in range(hsv.size[1]):
        h, s, v = accesser[i, j]
        accesser[i, j] = (int(h + 128) % 360, s, v)


# And we'll finish by converting back to RGB and adding in the Alpha channel from the original image.

# In[11]:


new_template = hsv.convert("RGB")
new_template.putalpha(colored_vinyl_template.getchannel("A"))
display(new_template.resize((160, 160), resample=0))


# Nice! Let's generate a bunch of random colored vinyl templates to get a sense for the variance we'll get.

# In[12]:


def create_colored_vinyl(
    template: Image.Image | None = None, hue_shift: float | None = None
) -> Image.Image:
    """Create a colored vinyl template
    (record texture with transparency for the center)

        create_colored_vinyl(colored_vinyl_template, hue_shift=hue_shift).resize(

# In[14]:

# Okay, so this appears to be working, although I'm sure I'm not using `random.random()` in the best possible way.

# ### Inlay

# As I mentioned at the start, the sample mp3 I grabbed includes album art, which I should be able to extract:

# In[15]:


with NamedTemporaryFile(mode="w+b", suffix=".png") as cover:
    higher.video.output(os.fspath(cover.name)).overwrite_output().run()
    display(Image.open(cover.name))


# _Heyyy_

# Now what if the input music _doesn't have_ album art? We can use the `ogg` we made earlier for testing here, as the album art should have been stripped.

# In[16]:


with NamedTemporaryFile(mode="w+b", suffix=".png") as cover:
    ffmpeg.input(os.fspath(assets_folder / "higher.ogg")).video.output(
        os.fspath(cover.name)
    ).overwrite_output().run()
    display(Image.open(cover.name))


# So that just raises a generic exception. But there are three options to pursue (besides a lazy try-except-pass):
# 1. Inspect the stream in advance to look for a video stream
# 1. Capture and inspect stderr to look for the exact error mesage
# 1. Pass in that  "trailing '?'" and see if we can push the error downstream
